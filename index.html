				<h2>About</h2>
				<span>
					My name is Grey. I am a highschool student 
					from the United States. For as long as I can
					remember, I have loved to create things.
					When I was in the fifth grade, my teacher 
					introduced me to a programming website called
					Scratch. I found enjoyment in making little 
					projects with this website. After about a year 
					of making Scratch projects, I moved on to Python, 
					then JavaScript and more recently Rust. Over 
					this time, I have also spread out from programming 
					into other creative skills such as digital art, 
					sewing and music. I have created this website to 
					showcase some of these projects.
