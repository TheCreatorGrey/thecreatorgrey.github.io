				I'm a highschool

				as a home for everything I make, including software, 
				games, tools, as well as 3D animations and models.
				You can visit the 
				<a href="/content/explorer/index.html">content branch</a>

				<h2>
					Computer programming
				</h2>

				<strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
				<span>
					I became interested in programming when I was introduced to "Scratch" in the fifth grade, a website designed to
					teach kids the basics of coding. Scratch appealed to me because it used simple blocks instead of text, and I
					didn't need to watch a tutorial to use it. Because it was so simple, I was able to start making projects immiediately,
					and this created an interest in programming that I didn't have before.
					
				</span>

				<br><br>
				
				<strong>Python (Since 2021)</strong> <br>
				<span>
					I used Scratch for about a year before I wanted to learn something that I could use to create faster and more advanced
					programs, so I watched a 3 hour beginner Python course on YouTube, and pretty soon, I was making projects with Python.
					One of the first libraries I learned was Ursina, a library that could be used to create interactive 3D programs in Python 
					with relatively simple code. One of my first projects with it was a basic sandbox game where you could move objects around
					by pressing keys and using them build things. Unfortunately, the messy and speghetti-like source code of that project is 
					long lost, but luckily I was able to find a couple screenshots of it. I've since made many more projects with Python, most of which are not publicly accessible.
				</span>

				<br><br>
				
				<strong>JavaScript, HTML and CSS (Since 2023)</strong> <br>
				<span>
					I began learning JavaScript not long after I began learning HTML and CSS. My main motive for learning these was my desire
					to write my own website. I didn't (and still don't) like website builders because of the lack of full ownership and control 
					over the overall appearance of anything made with them. I wanted my website to be truly mine, and it made sense for a 
					programmer to demonstrate their abilities through their portfolio itself. CSS in particular seemed weird and convolluted,
					but I eventually got comfortable with it. As I became more familiar with web development, I was able to make more than just
					pages.
				</span>

				<br><br>
				
				<strong>C and C++ (Since 2025)</strong> <br>
				<span>
					I briefly played around with C before I more recently started using C++, which so far I think is simpler and has better looking
					syntax. I don't have much experience with either of these.
				</span>

				<h2>
					Computer animation and modeling
				</h2>

				<strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
				<span>
					I've watched many, many animated films. I've always been fascinated by animation, particularly 3D computer animation. Most of
					the animated films I watched were by large studios, and because of this I didn't even begin to think that making such a thing
					alone would be feasible. I had seen a few behind the scenes bonuses, but was largely unaware of how computer animation worked.
					It wasn't until the late 2010s that I watched YouTube videos of animations people made by themselves on their home computers.
					Most of them looked comedically bad, but it showed me that computer animation could be accomplished not just by large studios,
					but by individuals. It was because of these YouTube animators that I was exposed to the open-source software called Blender. 
					I'll get to that later. My school's computers had Windows 10, which came pre-installed with a program called Paint 3D. This was
					not animation software, but it could be used to make simple 3D models. Like Scratch, it lead me to learn more advanced tools.
				</span>

				<br><br>

				<strong>Blender (Since 2021)</strong> <br>
				<span>
					For me, learning 3D software came hand-in-hand with learning programming. Around 2021, I knew the basics of Python as well as
					a library that I could use to make simple 3D interactive programs. As I mentioned before, I was using a program called Paint 3D
					that came pre-installed with Windows 10. This program could be used to make simple 3D models. I realized these models could be
					saved to files, and that those same files could be imported into the Python library. Paint 3D's navigation was limited, so I
					thought being able to walk around my models like in a video game was pretty cool. Of couse, the navigation was not the only aspect
					of Paint 3D that was limited. So, like I moved on from Scratch to Python, I moved on from Paint 3D and began to learn Blender.
					Initially, I wanted to use Blender to make better models for games, but I became less interested in game development and started
					using Blender for different things. In 2022, I made and published my first animation on YouTube. It had a few different names
					before I deleted the original YouTube channel where it was uploaded out of fear of being hacked. Since then I've reuploaded it 
					with the title "2022 Halloween Animation (reupload)". The easiest things for me to model were geometric and boxy things, like 
					furniture and rooms. It wasn't until about 2024 that I got better at making rounder, more irregularly shaped things such as
					character models. Most of the characters I made were just blobs with eyes, until 2025 when I started making better characters
					and animations using them.

				<h2>
					Design
				</h2>

				<strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
				<span>
					Around 2023 when I started making user interfaces for my projects, I didn't want to use premade icons because I wanted my projects 
					to be my own, so I used different tools to make them. At first, I used Vectr.com for vector icons and Piskel for raster icons. A lack of
					features or features I didn't like in those tools pushed me to use different tools, and in one case, make my own.
				</span>

				<br><br>

				<strong>InkScape (Since 2024)</strong> <br>
				<span>
					I began using InkScape when the online tool I was using to make vector art made an update that I didn't like very much. My knowledge of
					this program is pretty surface-level since I don't make vector art very often, but I figured it out well enough that I was able to make
					NeatInk, the font you're reading from right now (assuming your browser loaded it properly).
				</span>

				<br><br>

				<strong>GIMP (Since 2024)</strong> <br>
				<span>
					Around the time when I was making Scratch projects, I used an online tool called Piskel to make sprites, icons, and things like that for
					my games. I continued to use this until 2024 when I was making <a href="https://thecreatorgrey.com/voxelantis/">Voxelantis</a>, a Minecraft 
					Clone written in JavaScript. I wanted to make my own textures for it, and I was able to make decent textures in Piskel, but it didn't have 
					certain features I wanted, so I made <a href="https://thecreatorgrey.com/raster-online/">Raster Online</a>. I modeled Raster Online off of 
					Piskel, but with the features I wanted to make the textures for my Minecraft clone. Using my tool I was also able to make the icons for the
					tool itself as well as some background tiles for some pages on this website. Around the same time when I was making 3D models, I wanted to 
					process textures from photos I had taken with my camera to use on 3D models. To implement the features I needed to do this in my own tool was
					out of the question, so I looked to more advanced image processing software. I looked for free and open-source software that had the features 
					I needed, and naturally GIMP was my first choice. Since then I've mainly used it to process textures for my models.
