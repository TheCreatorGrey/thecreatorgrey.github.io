Most folders under content will have a file named index.json. This file
allows the explorer to index and see the content of these folders.

A folder which does not serve as a page but is meant to be indexed by the explorer is called a branch.
If a folder has an index.json file, it is probably a branch.

The format of these are as follows:

{
    "about":"A short description which appears next to a branch on the page of the parent branch",
    "description":"A long description. A very long description. Definitely longer than the about description, for sure. Absolutely.",

    "branches":[
        "Name of branch 1",
        "name of branch 2"
    ],

    "links":[
        {
            "type":"relative", 
            "name":"The Name Of The File Shown In The Explorer", 
            "link":"actualfilename.txt"
        },

        {
            "type":"url",
            "name":"Name Of Label For URL Shown In The Explorer", 
            "link":"https://thecreatorgrey.com",

            "metadata":"Potentially important information that is not required"
        }
    ]

    "styling":[
        "background":"/assets/backgrounds/optional_custom_bg.png",
        "bg_size":50,
        "column_color":[0, 0, 0, 0.5],
        "column_border_color":[255, 0, 255, 1],
        "character":"/assets/characters/optional_character.png",
        "icon":"/assets/icons/optional_icon.png"
    ]
}
