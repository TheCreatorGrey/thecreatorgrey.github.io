    "description":"An online tool for modeling 3D virtual spaces. Since its start, I've called it a game engine, level editor and now this. I'm not completely sure what to call it, mainly because my goals for what it should be have changed. The first Kodiak was a wrapper of Ursina, which is essentially a wrapper meant to make Panda3D simpler to use. A wrapper of a wrapper. Kodiak was meant to make Ursina even easier to use by adding a user interface similar to that of Roblox Studio and other 3D game engines. I had some success, but I eventually ran into errors that were both inconsistent and difficult to trace, so I gave up. I later remade it using Three.JS, which is a framework for creating 3D graphics in web browsers. At this point I had a different goal: I wanted a way to create 3D digital spaces easily and quickly. I have known how to use Blender since long before I started this project, but it didn't seem ideal for large, explorable models. I was also familar with Roblox Studio, which I decided to model this tool off of because it used flying navigation instead of Blender's orbiting navigation, which was perfect for large navigable models. I also liked that models would be broken up into simple, well-defined shapes rather than a mesh, which would get messy when trying to make large and complex models. You probably shouldn't make anything with this tool yet since it's very much subject to change. Not that anyone would use it anyways. \n\nStarted on 9/10/2024\nReleased on 9/13/2024",
