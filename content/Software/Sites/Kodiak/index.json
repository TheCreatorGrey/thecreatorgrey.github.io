    "about":"A format (and editor) for storing 3D virtual spaces (2024)",
    "description":"Kodiak is A file format made with the goal storing 3D virtual spaces (an example is video game maps) with a balance between file size and simplicity. Currently, the file format and the editor (which the link below leads to) are being developed at the same time. The idea is that because the format is relatively simple, more software that can read, display or explore the contents of the files can be written for different systems, architectures or in different programming languages. Why? I want to preserve the experience of video games. A file format for which software can be written to read it with relative ease is less likely to become useless or unreadable in the future, which is also why I avoid adding excessive features. I am trying to create a format which can store video games and their simulated environments in a way that is as simple and portable as possible. The format and editor have been designed with large, explorable models in mind. Currently, this is basically just a format for storing models, but it is very much subject to change. Interactive elements such as scripting may or may not make a return. I am most likely the only person who will ever use it, but It's been a pretty good learning experience. As of writing this description in 2026, progress is still being made. \n\nStarted on 9/10/2024\nReleased on 9/13/2024",
